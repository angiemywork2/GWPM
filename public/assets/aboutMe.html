	 		<div id="bio">
				<p>I am Dale Washington and God has positioned me in the Body of Christ as a teacher with a prophetic anointing.  I prophesy through dreams and visions..... a Daniel 5:12 anointing is what the Lord has given me.</p>
				
				<p>I became born again in 1994.  Afterwards, I attended a local church in which I served for 18 years in various capacities.  I served as a Sunday school/bible study teacher, an Evangelist, a praise and worship leader, a praise dancer, and an intercessor.  In 2007, I was ordained as an Evangelist in that very same ministry.</p>
				 
				<p>At some point during my service in that local church, perhaps near the end of my tenure, I was told by a figure of titled authority, that I was not a leader.  I served for several years in a leadership role in this local church, so I was quite taken aback by their comment.  When I inquired of God what was said to me, He spoke something to me that was one of the most defining moments of my life.  This is what GOD said, and I quote:<br><br>
				<b><i> "Man puts people in positions in the church organization, which is dead!  I position My people in the Body of Christ, which is a LIVING ORGANISM!"</b></i></p>
				 
				<p>In 2014, GOD called me out of the organized church religion.  Two years later, GOD transitioned me into sharing the gospel via the World Wide Web, and to reach the Nations through the ministry of Greater Works Prophetic Ministry.  GOD'S church, the Ecclesia, is truly a church without walls, where I am called to serve as a watchman on the walls.  And I would not take anything for my journey.  No turning back!</p>
			 
				<p>I've been commissioned by YAH GOD.  What GOD speaks privately, I speak publicly.</p>
